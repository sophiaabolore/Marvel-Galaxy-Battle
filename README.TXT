Key your eyes out for gems they appear at random locations.

Avoid the life subtracting asteroids by clicking the “up” bar to jump on a Plank. They only appear near the ground

Make sure the joker and Batman don’t steal your asteroids by killing them, pressing “space” bar, before they reach the other side.


You only start out with 20 hammers so make sure you replenish them by coming in contact with the rare White Dwarf for as long as you possibly can. The longer your in contact the more Hammers you get!

Use the “left and right” keys to move in different directions.


If you crash into Batman or The Joker an explosion occurs and you are teleported back to your starting position. (NOTE* during this process you might hit an asteroid and lose a life).
